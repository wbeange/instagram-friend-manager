Deployment Notes -

Server:

I didn't originally realize how heroku worked at first and I got lazy.
So for now copy over the app.rb file into a separate heroky repo
and deploy the server from there.

There's a heroku setting I should look at that let's you point to a github repository.

git add .
$ git commit -am "make it better"
$ git push heroku master

Client:

grunt build
firebase deploy
